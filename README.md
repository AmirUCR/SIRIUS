# Introduction
SIRIUS (_<ins>S</ins>ystematische <ins>I</ins>dentifikation <ins>R</ins>edundanter, <ins>I</ins>dentisch <ins>U</ins>ebersetzter <ins>S</ins>equenzen_) is a synthetic biology tool leveraging linear programming to design genetic sequences with the shortest and fewest possible homologous fragments between pairs.

- Design _n_ gene sequences given a protein _P_
- Extremely fast and computationally efficient
- Written in pure C++
