# Introduction
SIRIUS is a synthetic biology tool leveraging linear programming to design genetic sequences with the shortest and fewest possible homologous fragments between pairs. SIRIUS stands for _Systematische Identifikation Redundanter, Identisch Uebersetzter Sequenzen_.

- Design _n_ gene sequences given a protein _P_
- Extremely fast and computationally efficient
- Written in pure C++
